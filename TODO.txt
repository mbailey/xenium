xenium/TODO.txt

-- milestone 1
* don't list 'running' backup as completed
* check password being set
* deploy.rb should prompt for password and generate password file during cap:setup
* enter password twice when creating slice
* slice.create: ping new IP and warn if already active
* slice.create: don't create if guest by same name running (shutdown?)
* slice.list: order slices alphabetically
* slice.delete: ability to remove slice

-- milestone 2
* list of networks to accept connections from
* configure xen-config.sxp
* slice.edit: add pulldown for xenbr's
* crud for backups

-- milestone 3
* time slice creation and present big happy msg
* manage lvms
* tail logs


* warn if not running as root
* create_backup 
  - warn if diskspace low
  - refresh 'pending'

/slices : perhaps break into two lists. show running up top, and stopped below

make sure config writing works

backups - indicate when backup is not ready yet
* find out why bj is stopping

* list vg's (space free)

slice.create
- generate list of backups/debootstrap to install from
slice.destroy

how will we make slice.to_xml work?

dom0 is not really a slice

Add specs

slice.index: 
- controller buttons should refresh themselves whenever they are reporting a pending action
- display error if slice.start fails (not enough memory, etc)

toggle autostart on slices.list
slice.list    # icons for start, stop, pause, "refresh symbol", restart
ajax for slice_controls

slice.show
	config.show
	config.edit

How does github know about release versions for gems? Tags?

- create

# Networks
usable IPs exclude the first and last in the network
show: 
 
# IPs

paginate ips
ip model
- make Network module with Ip and Network classes  
- add values @string and @integer to ip_address

get http password from somewhere not checked into git
